# go-by-example-custom

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository is my hands-on learning journey through Go. I am recreating examples from [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/) with **my own code and extensions** to deepen my understanding of the Go programming language.

## 🚀 Project Goals

1. **Learn by Doing**: Write custom Go examples for each core language feature.  
2. **Explore Edge Cases**: Challenge myself to extend functionality, handle errors, and test limits.  
3. **Build Go Proficiency**: Develop clean, idiomatic Go code ready for real-world projects.
