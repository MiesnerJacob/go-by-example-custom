# go-by-example-custom
A personal journey through the Go programming language, inspired by Go By Example. Each concept is implemented with custom examples to reinforce understanding, explore edge cases, and practice writing clean, idiomatic Go code. This repository serves as both a learning resource and a reference for Go syntax, rules, and best practices.
